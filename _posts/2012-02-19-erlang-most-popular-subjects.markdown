title: Most popular discussions in Erlang-questions
---

After a long thead about [Misultin EOL] in erlang-questions I wanted to check
how active is it comparing to other threads in the mailing list. Honestly, I
was expecting for it to be at least in top 5.. But I was wrong.

Here are the top 50 discussions as of of 2012 January 19 00:15 UTC:
