title: Xen on Squeeze via libvirt, part 2
---

This is the continued attempt to run Xen-4 on squeeze via libvirt. Why libvirt?
Because if we manage to stick to it, we will have an awesome interface in the
future when we want to interfere with our hypervisors/VMs.

virt-install failed to do a very standard installation. One of the gotchas:
`xen-utils-common/squeeze` is inconsistent:

`/etc/xen/scripts/network-route` calls `hotplugpath.sh`, which exists only in
`xen-utils-common/sid`. Which, [according to my suspisions][suspisions], assumes Xen-4.1.

I did not dig really deeply into this, because [it is not worth
it][xen_networking]. Xen-4.1 (which is in `testing`) has a different approach
to configure networking. As well as many things like `xl` instead of `xm`.

Installing `xen-hypervisor-4.1/testing` offers to switch the whole system to
`testing`. Not an option. We do not want to use Ubuntu, right? So I continue my
efforts to backport Xen-4.1 to `testing`.

What next?
----------

Port Xen-4.1 with the whole userspace to stable.
