title: ErlMPC fine tuning in Spil Jam 
---

Spil Jam!
=========

Amazing event. People gather together, get some refreshers and start working on
whatever they fancy.

I purposed an idea to upgrade my ErlMPC player. Here is what we _visually_
achieved in between talking, drinking refreshers and having a great time:

Before:

![Version 0.1](https://github.com/Motiejus/erlmpc/raw/0.1/priv/static/screenshot-0.1.png "erlmpc running in Google Chrome 18")

After:

![Version 0.2](https://github.com/Motiejus/erlmpc/raw/0.2/priv/static/screenshot-0.2.png "erlmpc running in Google Chrome 20")

Thanks [Martin Reurings](http://www.windgazer.nl/) for CSS magic.

Moreover, now we have a greatly simplified JS part which allows us to do
whatever we like. Thanks Thijs de Zoete!

Many apologies to Ignacio, who had a great idea to make a playlist. However, I
failed to deliver an API to the backend on time, and this didn't happen. But
the API now is there, and the freedom to do the playlist is there!

Looking forward to the next jam! :)

Thanks again everyone.
